In case of a change in sea condition, zero crossing period and significant wave height values should change.

-A value other than 0 should be selected as the smallest frequency value. Otherwise, the value is infinite in obtaining the spectra and the result gives an error.

- You have must results if you performed analysis before and want to perform a new one
