# Johnswap-and-ITTC-Spectra-Calculation
Wave spectra must be calculated in order to make seakeeping calculations of floating objects. This shared code calculates the spectrum of the wave according to the determined sea condition. In case of a change in sea condition, zero crossing period and significant wave height values should change.
